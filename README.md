# Learning Node.js

by [Ben Nadel][bennadel] (on [Google+][googleplus])

This is a collection of experiments that I am using to help myself learn about
the Node.js fundamentals. As I have been getting into Node.js, I am finding 
that certain things (like dealing with Streams and Promises) can only be 
properly noodled-on in the context of some real-world(ish) contexts. As such, 
these experiments are intended to be sufficiently complex so as to help me 
really dig in and understand Node.js workflows.

## My Node.js Experiments - I Love JavaScript!
