# Learning Node.js

by [Ben Nadel][1] (on [Google+][2])

This is a collection of experiments that I am using to help myself learn about
the Node.js fundamentals. As I have been getting into Node.js, I am finding 
that certain things (like dealing with Streams and Promises) can only be 
properly noodled-on in the context of some real-world(ish) contexts. As such, 
these experiments are intended to be sufficiently complex so as to help me 
really dig in and understand Node.js workflows.

Want more JavaScript goodness (in general, regardless of Node.js)? Check out 
the [JavaScript blog entries][javascript-blog] on my website.
